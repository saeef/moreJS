# invoking functions as Constructors

- a constructor is just a function that is invoked using 'new'
- a constructor returns an object
- constructors are used to create multiple similar objects
- the returned objects share the same prototype which comes from the constructor

- when we are defining a function that we intend to use as a constructor, the
  convention is to use an uppercase letter in the name that references that 
  function
- you shouldn't invoke a function that created for the purposes of being used as
  a constructor ***without*** the keyword new


```
    ex: constructor

    var Greeting = function() {


    };

    var greet1 = new Greeting();

    var greet2 = new Greeting();

    greet1 instanceof Greeting;
    ==> true

    greet2 instanceof Greeting;
    ==> true

    //type:
    greet1;
    => 
        > Greeting
           name:"Greeting"
          >prototype: {Constructor} //prototype property for when the function is
                                    //used as a constructor

        //all objects created using the Constructor 
        //receive this Object as its prototype                          

```
