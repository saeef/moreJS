# invoking functions as Constructors

- a constructor is just a function that is invoked using 'new'
- a constructor returns an object
- constructors are used to create multiple similar objects
- the returned objects share the same prototype which comes from the constructor

- when we are defining a function that we intend to use as a constructor, the
  convention is to use an uppercase letter in the name that references that 
  function
- you shouldn't invoke a function that created for the purposes of being used as
  a constructor ***without*** the keyword new


```
    ex: constructor

    var Greeting = function() {


    };

    var greet1 = new Greeting();

    var greet2 = new Greeting();

    greet1 instanceof Greeting;
    ==> true

    greet2 instanceof Greeting;
    ==> true

    //type:
    greet1;
    => 
        > Greeting
           name:"Greeting"
          >prototype: {Constructor} //prototype property for when the function is
                                    //used as a constructor

        //all objects created using the Constructor 
        //receive this Object as its prototype                          

```



### constructor invocation and the value of this
- using a function declaration instead of a function expression
- there's no need to pass the function around

```
    function Greeting() {
      console.log(this);
    }

    //for testing purposes

    //invoke as a regular function
    Greeting();

    => Window

    //invoke with 'new' constructor
    new Greeting();

    => Greeting


```



- so when the 'new' keyword is used, it changes the value of 'this' to point
  to the new object just created



```
    ex: right way to use a Constructor

    function Users(fName,lName) {

        this.firstname = fName;
        this.lastname = lName;
        this.fullname = function() {

            return this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
        };

    }

    var user1 = new Users('James', 'Hetfield');


```
