# prototypes

- every object in javascript has a set of its own properties which are defined on the
  object and a set of properties that that object can access.
- those properties that it can access but aren't defined in the object itself are
  defined in the object's prototype.

#### understanding prototype

- almost every object is linked to another object. That linked object is called the 
  prototype
- objects inherit properties and methods from it's prototype ancestry (prototype chain)
- a prototype is automatically assigned to any object
- everything except primitives are objects
- you can define an objects prototype
- you can change properties and methods of a prototype

#### toString

```
    ex:

    var oneObj = {};

    "toString" in oneObj;           //'toString' is part of prototype (default)
    => true                         // 'in' simply looks to see if the object
                                    // has access to that property
    //in checks through the prototype
    //chain to find it                                



    oneObj.hasOwnProperty("toString");      //'hasOwnProperty' is part of prototype
    => false                                // 'hasOwnProperty' looks to see if the
                                            // property is defined on the object    

    //'hasOwnProperty' looks at the immediate object                                           


```



## understanding the prototype of functions

- every object in javascript has a prototype.
- functions are objects therefore functions have a prototype as well


#### inside a simple function

```
    ex: function test() {console.log('test');}


    > length: 0
    > prototype: object         //prototype property, if the function is used as a
                                //constructor
    > __proto__: function()     //this links to the prototype

      > apply: function apply()     //these 3 methods allow you to change
      > bind:  function bind()      //the value of 'this' when a
      > call:  function call()      //function is executed (explicitly bind this)
