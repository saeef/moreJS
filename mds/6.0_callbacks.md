# higher order functions: callbacks

- higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, by
  either taking them as arguments or returning them. The fact that javascript
  supports first-class functions, makes it possible to create Higher Order functions

- the most common example of higher order functions in javascript:
    + callbacks


```
    ex: callbacks

    - a well pattern for callback functions are listeners
    - we we setup a listener, we used a handler that is called whenever an
      an event occurs

      //the function (anonymous) we're passing to DOMContentLoaded is a callback

      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {

            var logo = document.querySelector('#logo');
            logo.addEventListener('click', function() {
                console.log('clicked');
            },false);

      },false);


      //also a callback - an anonymous fun

      var fullname = function() {

        setTimeout(function() {
            console.log(this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname);
        },150);
      };



```  



#### we can loose the value of 'this' with a callback


```
    var first = 'James';
    var last = 'Hetfield';

    var user1 = {
        first: 'Michael',
        last: 'Schummer'
    };

    var user2 = {
        first: 'Sandra',
        last: 'Marchesse'
    };

    var fullname = function() {

        setTimeout(function() {

            console.log(this.first + ' ' + this.last);

        },1000);

    };


    //the value of 'this' in the function is the global scope
    //in a normal function invocation - without the callback

    fullname();
    => 'James Hetfield'


    fullname.call(user1);
    => 'Michael Schummer'


    //NOW using 'setTimeout'

    fullname.call(user1);
    => 'James Hetfield'             //problem with callbacks


```



#### how to prevent the callback from messing with the value of 'this'

> using 'that' for 'this'

```
        ex: prevent callback from messing with 'this'

        var fullname = function() {
            //by adding below before setTimeout/callback
            var that = this;
            setTimeout(function() {
                
                console.log(that.first + ' ' + that.last);    

            },2000);

        };

```



> using 'bind'

- bind creates a new function that can be executed

- when the fullname function is executed, the value of 'this' will be bound to 
  the new callback function that is returned
- ..and should bind any object that we pass in using the 'call' method


```
        ex: prevent callback from messing with 'this'

        var fullname = function() {
            //by adding below before setTimeout/callback
           
            setTimeout(function() {
                
                console.log(this.first + ' ' + this.last);    

            }.bind(this),2000);

        };


        //so now

        fullname()      //returns this.first and this.last in global scope

        fullname.call(user1)    //returns this.first for user1

```




### arrow functions

- helps to solve the problem of 'this' using callbacks (when 'this' does 
  not end up being the value that we want)

- one of the reasons 'arrow' functions were introduced in ES6 is to take 
  advantage of lexical 'this' (where it is written/appears)  
- arrow functions is like using the bind method

```
    ex: arrow functions


    var sum = function(num1,num2) {

        return num1 + num2;

    };


    //as an arrow function

    var sum = (num1,num2) => num1 + num2;       //if we had more than a single
                                                //line we'll need curly braces


    - btw parentheses are the parameters 
    - no function keyword, that is replaced by the arrow (=>)
    - arrow also indicates what should be returned
    - so once num1 and num2 are added together, it automatically returned 
      those values.


    var funct1 = num => num * num;
    
    - no parentheses, because only a single value is being passed into function
    - it returns the value of the parameter being passed (num), multiplied by
      itself.


    var funct2 = () => 100;

    - here it just returns 100
    - nothing is being passed, so we need the parentheses here.  


    //arrow functions is like using the bind method

    var fullname = function() {

        setTimeout(function() {

            //code..

        },2000);


    };


    //so you can do this too: replace the function keyword with an arrow

    var fullname = function() {
        //this defines an arrow function
        setTimeout(() => {

            //code..

        },2000);


    };
