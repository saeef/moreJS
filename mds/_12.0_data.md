# reasons for separating data from code

- availability of the data - inputing data in a form
- location of the data - separate database location
- separation of concerns - a valid design priniciple
- manageability - keeping data separate from code can make it more manageable

#### separating data brings up loading data

***JSON*** data
- JSON is text structured like a javascript object
- JSON is used to store and exchange data. You can store a javascript object as text

#### using the JSON Object (stringify and parse methods)    
- you can convert a javascript object to JSON (stringify)

- JSON to javascript objects (parse)

> JSON values must be one of these data types: string(double quotes), number, object
> array, boolean, null.  ***NO undefined***

```
    ex: JSON object

    var json = '{                       // curly braces hold objects
                                        // square brackets arrays 
        "firstname": "Steven",          // name unlike a javascript object,
        "lastname": "Lancini"           // requires quotes.
    
    }';


    //to convert to a Javascript object (because it is a string data type)

    - pass it to a variable
    - use JSON.parse method

    ...
    ..
    > json;
    => "{"firstname": "Steven", "lastname": "Lancini"}"

    var obj = JSON.parse(json);          // or var obj = JSON.stringify(json); to go
                                         // back to something like this:
                                         // {"first":"stefano",....} string type is // obvious

    //now you can access, obj.firstname, just like you would an object

    > obj.firstname;
    => "Steven"

### JSON file

- when you're receiving JSON data from an external source such as a server, it comes
  as a `string of text`

- separation of data and code is a good reason to use `.json` files to manage data


```
    ex:   //json files begin with curly braces
          //properties and values in double quotes  

    {

        "ufo_files": 3,
        "whodid": true,
        "questions": [
            {
                "q1": "did biggie collude back in 1994 to kill tupac?",
                "weight": "50pt",
                "type": "fill-in",
                "ans": "5k per day and no cameras near the elevators, btw 7th and 48th in NYC, it would take the police two minutes max to arrive -but these people discharged their firearms and walked away - ufos maybe?
            },

            ...
            ......

        ]

    }


```


### loading JSON using `XMLHttpRequest()`

- create a new object   `var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();`

- change the mime type (a way to recognizing files on the internet) to json 
  (optional)

- use the open method and specify the http verb and file path or url

- the verb when grabbing a local file is usually GET, or if you're pushing data
  to the server verb is POST

- define a callback for the request

- the request will go out to get the file when it comes back and it indicates
  that it has the file
  Inside the callback, you'll parse the data that you've received and turn it into
  a javascript object.

  then send the request

  +  if GET -> what we send as part of the `send` cmnd will be `null`

  +  if POST -> you send `data` as part of your request



#### <kbd>errors</kbd> : `XMLHttpRequest cannot load. Cross origin requests` ...

- the `XMLHttpRequest` object depends on the `HTTP` protocol in order to work
  and since we're running the file locally, the `protocol` is not being used, so
  `XMLHttpRequest` object is not working as it supposed to.
  (you can run files in a local server)

- [object][object]  &nbsp; :santa:
    + possible parsing json problem - array
    + json not parsed or not iterating correctly
        + for example, if i was to leave out `['x'+c]` out of the loop below, I would get that or
        + if start iterating without first converting my json text into a real object first.

```
    islist = function() {
        //debugger;
        var b = 1;
        var c = 1;
        var obj = jsonObj.listItems;
        for(var prop in obj) {
            document.getElementById("b"+ b).
            innerHTML = obj[prop]['x'+c];
            b++;c++;
        }

    },

```
