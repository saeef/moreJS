# object oriented programming. (OOP)

- found in many of the modern programming languages
- a very popular technique for code organization and architecture
- it provides an overall approach to programming
- `javascript` is an object oriented language. Most everything, except for primitives
   are an object.
- javascript `deals` with `objects diferently` than traditional object oriented
  programming languages


#### differences

- in traditional OOP, you have to create a `class` and then you can instantiate that
  class to create a new object. So ***before*** an object can be created, a class
  structure must be established.
- in javascript, you can create an object , without setting up a class.

> eventhough, the ***ES6*** identifies a class, javascript is not truly a class
  based language. Javascript's object mechanism does not automatically perform copy
  behaviou when an object is created. Instead, javascript links objects together
  using the prototype.
